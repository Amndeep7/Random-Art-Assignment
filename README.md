Random-Art-Assignment
=====================

This program creates an image generated by randomly constructed mathematical expressions.  For further information on this program, please see the documentation.

This program, as of version 1.0, is intended to be based on a CLI.  A GUI version may be added at a later time.

Much thanks goes to Andrej Bauer for the initial formation of the idea and to Christopher A. Stone for making a lesson plan of it.

To run (this depends on which package you have):

RandomArtAssignment - Bare.jar
	You can double-click on this jar in order to run it on default settings (which are basically useless).  Otherwise, you may run it from the command-line, like so (without the exterior quotes): "java -jar "RandomArtAssignment - Bare.jar"".  You may append to this command various arguments so as to modify the image that will be generated.
